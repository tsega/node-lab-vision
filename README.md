# Vision

Is the [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) + [Express](http://expressjs.com/) application built during the course of the 
book [Advanced Express Web Application Development](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/advanced-express-web-application-development).
This repository is the home of my version of the application using GitHub's new [project feature](https://help.github.com/articles/tracking-the-progress-of-your-work-with-projects/) 
to manage the entire development process.
